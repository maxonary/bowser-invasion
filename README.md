## Game description

This game is a homage to the arcade game alien invasion. 
Instead of a spaceship shooting and destroying alien ships 
the game brothers Mario and Luigi are fighting against the 
invasion of evil Bowser. Just like in the original Mario Kart
series, the players are using green and red Koopa shells to
atack their enemies. 
Both players have to work as a team to achieve the highest score
while only having 3 tries...

## Playing game
Run the `bowser_invasion.py` file from the **bowser_invasion** directory
(i.e. `python3 bowser_invasion.py`)
To controll the mario character use the arrow keys left, right and up 
to steer in the correct direction and shoot shells towards the bowsers.
Luigi can be maneuvered by using the A and D key to go left and right,
as well as the space bar to shoot shells.
